It is a *Python* library for the *OpenSees* (the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) finite element framework. The topics covered in this notebook aim to provide some level of guidance to beginners in the aforementioned context, whilst anchoring them as best as possible to the Earthquake Engineering domain.\n",

    "Yet, let's see what [Minjie et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711017300584/) says:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*While Tcl is very flexible and has many strengths in string processing, it is not well-suited to scientific computing applications. Tcl’s use of strings as the only native data type and the resulting cumbersome syntax for mathematical expressions create a steep learning curve for users of OpenSees, many of whom learned MATLAB or Python as undergraduate engineering students.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*From its early use by researchers in PEER, OpenSees has grown to a large international user base. In 2016, there were over 1.5 million page views at its website http://opensees.berkeley.edu. OpenSees has been used as the primary simulation tool for numerous graduate theses in the United States and at major universities worldwide. The applications of OpenSees are cross platform (Windows, Linux, and OS X), range from simple serial applications through complicated parallel applications, and are widely used on a range of computing resources, including desktops, Amazon clusters, and high performance computing platforms. The finite element modules of OpenSees can also serve as the analysis engine for developing fragility functions that quantify the resilience of connected systems of civil infrastructure to a wide variety of natural hazards. To address research questions around community resilience, the IN-CORE multi-hazard decision framework uses Python as its glue language for linking structural fragilities generated by OpenSees to investment decisions for bridges, buildings, and electrical transmission systems.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*With its extension to Python, users of OpenSees gain access to the plotting library Matplotlib, numerical libraries Numpy and Scipy, interactive server Jupyter, 3-D visualization library Mayavi, statistics library pandas, web development library Flask, among others. In addition, OpenSees can now use the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), an open source, permissively licensed, cross-platform toolkit for scientific data processing, visualization, and data analysis, as one of its post-processing tools.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, *Tcl* is a rather difficult programming language to learn, and actually who learns it nowadays? It has a limited use. Yet, *Python* is widely used by many, and has some obvious advantages. Let me show you one of those advantages. Let's perform post-process the the results of static and dynamic analyses for Cingoli Bridge ([Ozsarac et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/15732479.2021.1956551)):"

    "- **Widely used** high-level programming language (shorter development time, slower executable file).\n",
    "- Emphasizes **code readability and flexibility** (e.g. use of whitespace indentation).\n",
    "- Python is an **interpreted language** which means that Python directly executes the code line by line. This makes debugging easier.\n",
    "- Python is **dynamically typed** language. It automatically assigns the data type during execution (no need to define data types)\n",
    "- **Large and comprehensive library available** (e.g. pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy). Python package index (PyPi) consists of over 200,000 packages.\n",
    "- Python versions: **Python 2.x** and **Python 3.x** (the former is legacy; the latter, introduced in 2008, is the present and future of the language).\n",

    "- The stable version Python is located [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "- Python can be used in a development environment. For beginner level users one of the most popular software for development is [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) (includes PyQT for development of Graphical User Interfaces, editor with syntax highlighting, Python console, etc). For MATLAB users who are willing to learn Python, Spyder is a perfect start.\n",
    "- Alternatively, one can make use of Python distributions, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (includes Spyder, jupyter - an open-source web application that allows to create and share live code, and a comprehensive set of libraries, etc).\n",
    "- Yet, many professional developers prefer to use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as a development environment.\n",
    "- Popular platforms such as [Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) can also be used. It is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.\n",
    "- Another alternative option to use [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) which turns a Git repo into a collection of interactive jupyter notebooks. For example, if you are using the binder links provided in course module, the python envrionment has already been set for you, and notebooks are already available. \n",
