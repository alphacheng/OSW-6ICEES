    "# <font color=blue>About the Course Module</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "This module aims to familiarize individuals from a non-programming background, namely coming from a Civil Engineering environment to the use of Python. Its direct intent is to make up for the general lack of knowledge of valuable programming skills within the Civil Engineering community in Turkey, although this context may characterize other countries and/or fields of expertise as well. The topics covered in this set of notebooks are, by no means, comprehensive within the world of Python, rather aiming to provide some level of guidance to beginners in the aforementioned context, whilst anchoring them as best as possible to the Civil Engineering domain. Aside from these topics, the module has been extended to cover OpenSeesPy: Python library for the OpenSees finite element framework. The target audience for this part is considered to have a background in Earthquake Engineering.\n",

    "The base course material presented here was originally prepared in the context of **Python for Beginners** course taught in *Eucentre* by *António Silva*, hence his efforts are greatly appreciated. The course material was extended by *Volkan Özsaraç* with the aim of introducing *OpenSeesPy* library to the Earthquake Engineering community."
