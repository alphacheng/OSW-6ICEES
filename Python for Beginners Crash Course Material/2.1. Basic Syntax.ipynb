An identifier can have any letter from A to Z (or a to z), or an underscore or  digits (0 to 9). Python does not allow punctuation characters (e.g. @, $, #, %) within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, `Manpower` and `manpower` are two different identifiers in Python."
