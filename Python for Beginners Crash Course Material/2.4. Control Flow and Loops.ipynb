    "The Python syntax for conditional execution of code uses the keywords `if`, `elif` (else if) and `else`. These conditional statements control the flow of the algorithmn, and, characteristically of Python, program blocks are defined by their indentation level. It's important to note that within the same flow hierarchy, the first match exits the flow. Furthermore, in the absence of a general `else` statement, all the conditions specified before with `if` and `elif` should be comprehensive, since if no match is found, an error will be raised.\n",
